# CPP Practice
This is one of my repo for all my c++ practice codes. You will see that it's "very" messy as I kinda lazy to organise it.

Actually this repo is for my practice use for the upcoming event. So, you may also drop a suggestion on how can I practice for newer stuff.

If you see my codes is kinda trashy and you want to fix it for me, drop a pull request and I will check about it.
